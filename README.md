# Bank-Simulator-Revision-2

Hey guys! Muhammad Oyonumoh here again...

This is a revised version of the previous version. I modified the modules into one because of circular reference error. 

NOTE: DO NOT run the main.py, Point the Run Configuration to functions.py

As in the previous one, this project is a Bank Simulator that simulates the banking system and operations, which includes account opening, account balance check, deposit and transfers/withdrawals. 
The aim of this Project is basically to create and manage your own bank at home.

This program works with MySQL database, which must be installed on your machine before running this program.

You must be connected to MySQL database for the program to work properly. You may install xampp from the link provided below, and start mySQL and Apache from the xampp application.

Get xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

After installation of xampp and running MySQL & Apache, run the Bank Simulator program (functions.py) and follow the prompts. That's all. Enjoy!

Please, I need contribution to make this programm much better.

I am yet to add email notifications for transactions. This will be in the next revision, God willing.
